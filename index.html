<h2>MY KEY FEATURES</h2>
<li> FAMILY PERSON</li>
<p>I am type of person that always put my family first and always  share my story and moments together with my family.I believe that everything that we are doing right now and our sucessful are from family. The prayer, especially from our mom is the best key and one of a factor to sucess. They are like a vitamin to myself. Eventhough, sometimes I feel down over something, I will reflect back all of my journey and also think that my family never give up support me and give me stregth during my up and downs. So that they reason why i prefer to spend more time with my family because they are my backbones and everythings.</p>
